# svdtools

**svdtools** is a Python package for modifying vendor-supplied, often buggy SVD
files. It can be imported as a library for use in other applications, or run
directly via the included `svd` CLI utility.

A common use case is patching vendor-supplied SVD files, then applying
[svd2rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust) to the resulting patched
SVD.

## Getting Started

Python 3.6 or newer is required to install and use `svdtools`. To install:

```bash
$ pip3 install --upgrade --user svdtools
```

Once installation has completed, the `svd` utility can be called from the command line.

An example is given in `make example`, which calls
`svd patch example/incomplete-stm32l4x2.yaml` and generates a patched SVD file
`example/stm32l4x2.svd.patched`.

See [Device and Peripheral YAML Format](#device-and-peripheral-yaml-format) for
more information on creating patches.


## Develop

To each their own, but the intended workflow is as follows:

1. Setup a virtual environment via `make setup`; this also installs the `svd` CLI
2. Activate the virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate` (or use [direnv](https://direnv.net/))
3. Iterate, running `make check` and `make fix` as necessary


## Device and Peripheral YAML Format

The patch specifications are in [YAML](https://yaml.org/), and have the following
general format:

```yaml
# Path to the SVD file we're targeting. Relative to this file.
# This must be included only in the device YAML file.
_svd: "../svd/STM32F0x0.svd"

# Include other YAML files. Path relative to this file.
_include:
    - "../peripherals/gpio_v2.yaml"

### Name Matching

Peripheral, register, and field names can be specified:

- Directly (eg. the full name of the peripheral/register/field)
- Using `?` and `*` for single- and multi- character wildcards
- Using `[ABC]` to give a list of possible matching characters
- Using commas to separate a list of possible matches

You must quote the name if using any special characters in YAML.

The enumerated values `On` and `Off` are treated as a boolean in YAML and Python will throw the error:
`AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'startswith'`, which does not give
you much information about where the error is. To avoid it, surround the values with
quotes like any other special character.

### Style Guide

- Enumerated values should be named in the past tense (*enabled*, *masked*,
etc.)
- Descriptions should start with capital letters and should not end with a period
